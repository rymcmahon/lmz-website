  <p class="static-page-paragraph">Inspired by Confucius’ notion on benevolence, I am introducing a sliding scale.
     I feel that this is a good route to take to make treatments more accessible for all.
     There is one fee ranging from $80-$150.</p>
  <p class="static-page-paragraph">Any herbs purchased will be added onto the total for the treatment.
    Please note that the rate is chosen by the patient.  There is a sliding scale
    income guideline below for reference…it is just a reference.  If you feel that
    you cannot afford the minimum, alert me.  I am willing to work with you as I am
    committed to make acupuncture available to all.</p>
  <p class="static-page-paragraph">If you are inspired to pay above the recommended pay range, please feel free
    to do so in order to benevolently subsidize others who cannot afford the minimum. </p>
  <p class="static-page-paragraph">Note the following are only guidelines.  Certainly there are times in our lives
    when we are more financially liquid and more financially challenged.  Also, if
    you are coming for treatment with greater frequency (2+ times/month), it is
    anticipated that you might pay on the lower end of the scale.</p>
