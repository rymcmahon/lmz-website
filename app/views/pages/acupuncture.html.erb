    <p class="static-page-paragraph">The most common question that an acupuncturist hears when someone finds out that is what you do for a living is: What is acupuncture good for? Then comes the list we might provide:</p>

    <p class="static-page-paragraph">That answer is then generally followed up with the statement that they have nothing wrong with them, but that they are simply curious. This sparks a conversation about the Yellow emperors Cannon wherein there is a discussion about what to charge for acupuncture. In this discussion, the Yellow Emperor states that patients will pay you as long as they feel good.  If there arises and imbalance that causes them discomfort or illness, then they will be treated without charge until the imbalance is corrected. The idea here is that acupuncture is meant to be utilized as a prophylactic treatment. One is meant to use acupuncture to create balance in their lives just like good food, exercise, and proper sleep are meant to do.</p>
    <p class="static-page-paragraph">Acupuncture is meant to create balance in the body so that it can heal itself. The Acupuncture “prescription” of points are there to balance the constitution of the patient as well as the presenting symptoms, if there are any. These points communicate with each other about how to get into the body to affect a change. Acupuncture also creates balance emotionally and spiritually…there are points for both on the body. So in a nutshell, acupuncture creates balance for body, mind and spirit. Having that balance results in a resilient healthfulness that allows you to meet the demands of life: environmental, physical, emotional, mental stressors. The balance that acupuncturists strive for is a balance of qi, the vitality of the body.  And with that balanced qi, the body is vital, and in a place to thrive, not just survive.</p>
